# Tractian Mobile Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the Tractian Mobile Engineer challenge repository!

This repository contains the implementation for the Mobile Engineer challenge by Tractian. All required features specified in the challenge prompt have been implemented, and all filters are functioning correctly.

Challenge repository: https://github.com/tractian/challenges/tree/main/mobile

## Implemented Features
- Implemented all features as specified in the challenge prompt.
- All filters (search, sensor_type, sensor_status) are operational and tested.

## What Could Be Improved with More Time
If I had more time to work on this project, here are the improvements I would focus on:
- Implementing additional unit tests for repositories to ensure robustness.
- Creating an end-to-end test with the API to verify the entire application flow.
  
Due to time constraints, I focused on writing tests specifically for the view in the `TractianTreeView` widget.
